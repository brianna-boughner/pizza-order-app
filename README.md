# pizza-order-app

An app for ordering pizza: customers can create and order a custom pizza.

*side note: I drew all of the graphics myself so I hope you enjoy them*

The app doesn't have a wide variety of 'actors', since the main target is customers of the pizza store.

**Requirements:**

-> USER FRIENDLY

The user must be able to easily create and order their pizza to encourage them to return as a customer.
There will be a limited amount of functions (only checkboxes for different toppings/sizes)
The price will be displayed at the top, and updates when the size or toppings change.
A graphic of the pizza will also be displayed at the top, and when toppings are added they will be added to the pizza.
This will create a more enjoyable experience to the customer.

-> USE CASE

The user opens the app. The first screen is displayed: creating the base of the pizza.

*note - you can move between the three 'tabs' easily throughout the pizza making process, so you can change your mind about toppings*

On this page, you can choose the size of the pizza (small, medium or large) as well as the type of crust (thin, regular or thick)
Using the bottom navigation bar, you can move to the next tab and choose your meat toppings. Some toppings are free, and some will cost extra.
On the final tab, you can choose the vegetarian toppings. Like the meat, some toppings will be free and some will cost extra.
Finally, you click the "place order" button. A screen will be displayed which says "thank you for your order"
